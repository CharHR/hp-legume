## Introduction

[Open Tree of Life](https://tree.opentreeoflife.org/about/open-tree-of-life) aims to construct a comprehensive, dynamic and digitally-available tree of life by synthesizing published phylogenetic trees along with taxonomic data. I think of it as the phylogenetic version of GBIF. GBIF combines data from thousands of herbarium datasets into a system that allows anyone to access occurrence data in a geographic area or of a taxonomic group.  Likewise OToL, since we don’t have a single analyzed phylogenetic tree of all life does the same with open access data. OToL users can download a subset tree for example for all of Fabaceae or from a list of species.   As with GBIF the better the input data the better the output data.  OToL trees can be used for many purposes including research and for visualizations.


It is important to recognize that the OToL synthetic tree includes terminals from published phylogenetic analyses from many  sources (various genes, sampling and morphology) and terminals that are placed there only by taxonomy.  OToL has a robust Taxonomic Name Resolution Service (TNRS).  Many terminals in the tree are known only from the taxonomy, that is they are not currently represented in a source phylogeny currently in OToL.   For example the Fabaceae clade ([OTT: 560323](https://tree.opentreeoflife.org/opentree/argus/ottol@560323/Fabaceae)) includes 24,479 species but only [4,835 species’](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1YQz6F-DOdCTZneGvEfnCtMZs6nyUTmp0N7le86aYnoY/edit?usp=sharing) placement are based on input phylogenies. Species that are not in any input trees are placed as a polytomy at the genus level resulting in polytomies. Therefore we need to input as many high quality trees as possible. With the help of OToL one can download a tree that only includes terminals that are from phylogenetic analyses. For info about OToL see the about tab [here](https://tree.opentreeoflife.org/about/open-tree-of-life).

We have been working closely with [Emily Jane McTavish](mailto:ejmctavish@ucmerced.edu) from UC Merced and a OToL PI. She has sent me much information including the synthetic trees and lists below.  She is keen to work with us to improve the Fabaceae clade of OToL. Please note that it is very easy to import a phylogeny from [Treebase](https://www.treebase.org/treebase-web/home.html) into OToL for further curation.  Therefore harvesting legume [Treebase](https://www.treebase.org/treebase-web/home.html) studies is the first place to improve the OToL synthetic tree.

Given the trees that are in the OToL and the distribution of the people interested in the project it may be the best option to start with this subfamily subset: Caesalpinioideae (incl. mimosoid clade), Dialioideae, Detarioideae, Cercidoideae, and Duparquetioideae.
 

Here is what we have as of late January 2021:



This is a [google spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Fvf6UJ7Q35Mu9bmmx4f2gtj7ple2N9OEEIhM4SNnuqA/edit#gid=1233710896) that lists the status of trees in OToL and some potential target trees to import:

* This list of trees was pulled from LPWG citations mainly.

Priority for inclusion: categorization of whether we think this is a priority for curation and inclusion (High, Medium, Low and uncategorized). We have hidden studies in which we think are in need of curation but only have a few legume species (based on title) and not worth the work.  We need your input here.
Clade old subfamily: Notes of the high level study group (please edit)
Genus or such: Notes of the high lower study group (please edit)

TO DO: 
Please look at the Clade old subfamily  & Genus or such columns and update if we have made mistakes.  The goal of these two columns is to help us ID areas of the phylogeny where we have adequate coverage and areas that need work. It would be great to have a better curated list on the pulldown menu to sort the studies. Or add these new names Caesalpinioideae (incl. mimosoid clade), Dialioideae, Detarioideae, Cercidoideae, and Duparquetioideae.
Priority for inclusion: It doesn’t take much work to complete the curation of these trees and include them but it still takes time.  Do we have these labeled right. Please edit and suggest.

Potential trees to import tab

This is a candidate list of studies that we could import into OToL.  It is based on legume studies I could find in Treebase (although I have not looked for Treebase trees from the last year or so) and the reference list of trees from LPWG papers.

Our strategy has been to look at these study titles and decide if it is worth pursuing. If it is we looked for the study pdf (folder here), then see if there is a Treebase ID in the paper or any public depository that has the tree.  This is time consuming and frustrating and for these reasons we stopped. I think it would be much easier with expert suggestions and knowledge of who has the trees, see next section.

This has the following column headers:

Status:
In Treebase: These could be imported to OToL and curated
pdf, not in treebase: We found pdf but not a publically available tree
Just looked in the text but have not contacted author
The tree may be out there
pdf check for tree
Found the pdf but have not looked for tree
to assess or find pdf
Looks promising need to look for information

Priority (treebase IDs): also see the following column of notes
Regardless of whether the study is easily available - does it look like something we need, this is usually based on the title and we edited two columns: Clade old subfamily and genus or such
Includes Treebase number if available
Ranked 1-4 in priority (we hid  #3 and 4 low priority)


Suggest a tree (study) tab

The major problem of the previous method is that it focused on older trees, it would be much better to start by including the best, largest and most recent trees that are not in this tab. So it would be most useful to get your input.

What makes a good tree to import (if we have to prioritize)
Study of a clade not yet in OToL
Need broadscale trees for the backbone
Need species level tree of every genus
A tree that is in Treebase or in a public database or we know the author has it
A more recent tree
For example I have only included my most recent Australian Acacia tree because all of my older studies are basically poorer subsets of this tree. 


TO DO:  Please suggest trees/studies to incorporate in this project  and to the synthetic OToL tree.  This includes the tree file  itself and help in curating it in OToL, which is easy.  In other words please add your trees and we can prioritize their inclusion.



Publication idea
We could rewrite a paper describing the before and after this project. How many species and studies did we add? How much better/useful is the OToL phylogeny? Provide examples of how the tree would be used, especially in connection to the taxonomic georeferencing group work.
