## Introduction
Under the Legume Phylogeny Working Group subfamily classification of legumes (LPWG, 2017), subfamily Caesalpinioideae was re-circumscribed as a clade that excludes Cercidoideae, Detarioideae, Dialioideae and Duparquetioideae (all of which were previously part of Caesalpinioideae), but which now includes the nested mimosoid clade (former subfamily Mimosoideae). Caesalpinioideae comprises ~150 genera and ~4400 species, with ~75% of the species in the mimosoid clade.
A new tribal classification of Caesalpinioideae is needed to reflect emerging phylogenetic resolution and will be forthcoming soon. Recent phylogenomic work by Koenen et al. (2020) provides a robust phylogenomic backbone for the mimosoid clade and this has been used to recognize a set of informally named subclades within the mimosoid clade, including ‘core mimosoids’ and a large ingoid clade
Caesalpinioideae date back to the late Paleocene when the subfamily is known from fossil bipinnate leaves from Colombia, and it is likely to be the legume subfamily with the oldest crown age (~58 Myr) (Koenen et al. 2020) These fossils indicate that Caesalpinioideae were already an abundant element in the earliest Neotropical rain forests in the Paleocene. Caesalpinioideae have thus diversified throughout the Cenozoic and now comprise diverse, abundant, and sometimes dominant elements across all major lowland tropical biomes, including tropical rain forests, savannas and seasonally dry tropical forests.
The Caesalpinioideae include some of the largest genera in the legume family, including Acacia, with > 1,000 species concentrated in arid parts of Australia, and Mimosa with > 500 species mostly in the Neotropics. Other species-rich genera include Inga with c. 300 species restricted to the Neotropics almost entirely in rainforests, and Vachellia (c. 160 species) and Senegalia (c. 220 species), two pantropical genera concentrated in drier environments, within which the iconic umbrella-crown trees of savannas, especially in Africa, are found.
