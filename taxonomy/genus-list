## Taxonomy
The LPWG has been working in collaboration the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, to update the names of legume species and their synonymy (see [Taxonomy Working Group](https://hp-legume.gbif-staging.org/working-groups/taxonomy)) and provide a single list of accepted legume species names. This list is curated as part of the World Checklist of Vascular Plants ([WCVP]( https://wcvp.science.kew.org/)), which links to the International Plant Name Index ([IPNI](https://www.ipni.org/)) and also underlies the [Plants of the World Online](http://www.plantsoftheworldonline.org/) website. 

## Genus List
This is a list of all accetped genera listed alphabetically, with links to their subfamily page, GBIF and Plants of the World Online pages.
