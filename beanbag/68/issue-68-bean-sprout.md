***Bean Sprouts*** is a new online, international legume systematics and evolution club where graduate students, early career scientists, and the broader community can connect, share research, and invite speakers, centered around our favorite (the best) plant family!  

We meet as a ***Journal Club*** to discuss recent papers and are hoping to start a ***Virtual Legume Seminar Series*** to explore current research around the world. Please let us know if youâ€™re interested in participating!  

Email **Sophie Winitsky** (<winitskys@gmail.com>) or **Joseph Charboneau** (<jcharbon@email.arizona.edu>) to be included!
