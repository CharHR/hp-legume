The Oasis Wildlife Botanical Garden in Fuerteventura in the Canary Islands grows many succulent plant species and has a large area devoted to plants of the spiny forest of Madagascar. They grow *Delonix regia*, *D. decaryi*, *D. pumila*, *D. floribunda*, *D. leucantha*, *D. boiviniana* and even have a small specimen of *D. velutina*. Some species (*D. regia*, *D. decaryi*, *D. pumila* and *D. floribunda*) flower and set fruit regularly, so they are abe to reproduce them. The garden also grows *Colvillea*, which flowers every year but has never set fruit. They are looking to complete their collection and are looking for seeds of *D. edule*, *D. brachycarpa* and *D. tomentosa.*
