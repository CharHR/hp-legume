**[GBIF launches hosted portal service](https://www.gbif.org/news/5D3ijLXMbpiZDBj0y0z1J/gbif-launches-hosted-portal-service)**

The GBIF Secretariat is delighted to invite its network members to apply for hosted data portals.

For more information and to apply for a portal vist the [GBIF hosted portal site](https://www.gbif.org/hosted-portals).

This [legume portal](https://www.legumedata.org/) is an  example of GBIF thematic hosted portal. 

This GBIF program also offers hosted portals for individual collections and institutions such as the [Natural History Museum Rotterdam](https://specimens.hetnatuurhistorisch.nl/). You can also check out the [ACME template](https://hp-nhc-template.gbif-staging.org/) that can be used to build your customized portal.

These portals are free and and only require that the institution share data with the GBIF network.
